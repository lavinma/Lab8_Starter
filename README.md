How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
<br/>Graceful degradation is about ensuring a website still works under poor conditions that could be something like slow or no internet. Service workers support this by caching important files (like HTML, JS, CSS, and recipes) and intercepting fetch requests. This allows the app to continue functioning and displaying content even if the user is offline. This helps improve reliability and user experience without needing a server connection.
